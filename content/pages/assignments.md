The following assignments are due for this course.

Three Short Papers
------------------

The short papers are designed to prepare students to write the long paper. They should be between 1,000 and 1,250 words in length (around four double-spaced pages). Each assignment is designed around a particular skill.

The first paper assignment asks students to analyze a piece of political rhetoric in light of the themes covered in Part I of the course.

The second paper asks students to apply a theoretical framework to a set of facts.

The third paper asks students to adjudicate between competing theoretical frameworks as accounts for a specific political phenomenon.
